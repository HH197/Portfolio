In this project, we used a novel optimization procedure combined with modern machine learning software packages to overcome the scalability and efficiency challenges inherited in traditional tools. We showed that our implementation is more efficient than both conventional models and deep learning models. We assessed our proposed model, [ZINB-Grad](https://github.com/HH197/ZINB-Grad), and compared it with [scVI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0229-2#Sec43) and [ZINB-WaVE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02554-5), both developed at the UC Berkeley, using a set of benchmarks, including run-time, goodness-of-fit, imputation error, clustering accuracy, and batch correction.

Deep Generative Modeling and Probabilistic Dimension Reduction](https://github.com/HH197/Deep-Generative-Modeling-and-Probabilistic-Dimension-Reduction)**

In this project, I re-engineered the implementation of the [scVI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0229-2), built at the University of Berkeley, and enhanced the code reliability and efficiency using Pytorch, Pytorch Lightning, and Pyro, resulted in a general dimension reduction and data imputation tool.

Car Price and Heart Failure prediction using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)](https://github.com/HH197/GLM-project)**

Here, we used two different data sets to show the broad applications of the GLMs in real-world problems. We devised Gamma regression and logistic regression models to predict Car price and Heart Failure. In our analyses, we focused on model fitting and highlighting the statistically significant variables for prediction using step-wise log-likelihood ratio test and AIC test.
